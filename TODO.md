# TODO

- a way to map buttons to midi notes, aka configurable scales
    - what does that take?
    - a control struct
      - with a collection of inputs and outputs
      - nodes take input objects, which can be scaled hardware inputs or scaled software inputs
      - something to represent the signal nodes
    - an I/O buffer (the pinout file?)
